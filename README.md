# Connect(); 2016 Training Materials

## Welcome to the Xamarin University eXam application

This application was created as part of our Connect(); 2016 training day. You can watch the recorded videos to see it's construction [here](https://university.xamarin.com/connect2016).

### Overview

This is a Xamarin.Forms application which can target iOS, Android, Windows 10 UWP, Windows 8.1, and Windows 8.1 Phone. It has platform-specific "head" projects for each supported platform, and a core PCL library with all the logic and screens written in XAML for the application. In addition, we have some UI tests which can be run locally with Xamarin.UITest, or in the cloud with [Xamarin Test Cloud](https://testcloud.xamarin.com) or [Visual Studio Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com).

### Extas

There are some other extra projects here as well added by the instructors that led the training. Make sure to check through the repository to see what all is present!
